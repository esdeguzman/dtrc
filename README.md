# # About this project

The Nightcrawlers Guild decided to create a simple website that shows players how their Devikins can be of use inside the upcoming game.

Some of the players are not so happy with their common NFTs. This should not be the case, the developers already said that there might be a separate pop ladder (dungeon?) for common NFTs, unless their team decided not to make it.

Nonetheless, this project shows what are the possible roles a Devikin might have in a players team.

Whether a player is currently looking for a specific role for his/her dream team or just checking he/she might already have, this is sure to help them out.
